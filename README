A Java library for storing encrypted data. 

The implemented container uses AES-256 encryption in Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode. 
Additionally a HMAC-SHA1 message authentication code is appended to the container
to protect the message's integrity and authenticity. To simplify manipulation of 
encryption keys, an additional class com.jkovacic.cryptoutil.Pbkdf2 is included. It
can be utilized to derive keys of any length from a passphrase. 

The library uses its own implementation of AES encryption engine (based on the 
Bouncy Castle project: http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html). This way it is 
ensured to work with any recent version of Java (it was tested with version 1.6), 
without the need to update any jurisdiction policy files.

For a brief introduction of the library, see CryptoContainerTest.java and
PBKDF2Test.java. Additionally, Javadoc documentation about the API can be generated.

The library is licenced under the Apache 2.0 license. See LICENSE.txt and

The author of the library is Jernej Kovacic (jkovacic AT gmail DOT com).
